*** DISCLAIMER ***
This project was thrown together rather quickly and is not in any kind of
finished state and my still have bugs and/or crash unexpectedly. I plan on
adding features and polishing the app as I have time.

TODO:
I am not able to get tests to run at the moment and thus the app is not tested yet.
